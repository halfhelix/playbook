## 📔💪 Our Playbook

Half Helix is a collaborative digital agency that partners with organizations to create modern digital experiences for culture and commerce. Together, we transform ideas into connected products and platforms for mobile and the web.

## ♻️ Our Model

Our business model is very simple:

Step 1) Make Good Work

Step 2) Wait for Emails

## 💯 Our Ways

We're a collabrative agency. That means each person working on your project has a share in the company - be it a designer, developer, or producer. This means our motivations are radically different than traditional agencies and we're able to do things that other cannot.

Traditional agencies have a lot of overhead and are fundamentally lifestyle businesses. Their business model is to hire staff, double or triple their salaries, then repackage it for sale to clients. In contrast, our cooperative model gives each member of our team a share in ownership and profits. By flipping the agency paradigm, each one of us is deeply invested of the sucsess of all of our projects.

## 🙏 Our Beliefs

**Experiment often**

We’re constantly adapting and evolving. Change is how we grow and improve. By encouraging our team and clients to takes risks and step out of their comfort zones, we stay at the front of our rapidly advancing field.

**Fuel creativity**

On projects, our team have a time allowance for creative experiments + space to play and get messy. Why? Because creativity is a practice just like anything else. If we take care of it, we can do our best work.

**Share knowledge**

Our approach invites new ideas and exploration. We believe in a horizontal management structure, where everyone in the team is empowered to participate cross-discipline and that the best solution is always a collaboration client and creator.

**Reward bravery**

New ways of working require new incentives. Our team receives a percentage of profits on repeat business generated by their hard work. Because we reward brave thinking with profit sharing, everyone you work with is highly motivated and committed to the success of the project.
