# Hello

We are NO2. We’re a modern design and development agency.

We have worked with cliets from all over the world, from individual founders who are self-funded, to large multi-national organizations. We have also created our own side products and businesses.

This is our playbook. It’s the who, what, where, when, and why of our agency. It details how we run client projects and daily operations. It's a combination of things we've learned over the years and a study of others' experiences. It is a living document, and like everything else, is consistently being updated as our processes and preferences evolve.

## High level guidelines:

- "Who cares?" Well, we do.
- Keep things clean, lean, and consistent.
- Have an opinion, but hold them loosely.
- Speak like a human.
- Maximize efficiency and minimize re-work.
- Small improvements, everyday.
