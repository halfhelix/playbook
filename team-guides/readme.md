# Team Guides

There are 3 high-level roles in our agency: Designers, Developers, and Project Managers.

### Designers
The job of the designer involves considering how a user will interact with the website or app and creating interfaces that are usable, intuitive, and intelligent.

### Developers
The job of the developer is to assess the goals of the project along side the intensions of the designs, then write code that turns ideas into reality. Often developers fall into the category of either "frontend" or "backend", but more on that later.

### Project Managers
Project managers are the liason between between designers, developers, and clients. Although all project participants collabrate on a daily-basis, the project manager parses ongoing client requests, shifts in priority, and changes in scope to ensure we deliver on-time and in-budget.
