## Billing Types

We have 3 different billing types, each type is best suited for different types of projects.

**Project Rate:** We use project rates for smaller projects that have a clearly defined scope. We provide a rate for a pre-defined scope and issue change orders for any work that falls outside of the original scope.

**Hourly Rate:** We use a per person, per hour rate for larger projects whose scope is not entirely defined. The work required for each project dictates the number of people and number of hours, which then determines the cost and how much gets quickly things get done. This allows for the most flexibility to add or remove items from project scope on-the-fly.

**Retainers:** We offer ongoing month retainers for clients that need ongoing support. This solution works best for clients that know theyâ€™ll have continuous needs and want to ensure Agency availability.

## Hourly Rate vs Project Rate
Some (although very few) client relationships start with a requirements document with detailed requirements and clear project scope. However, this is usually not the case. Most projects start with an idea and a business need. And these ideas usually need to be explored. Projects are full of surprises, technical puzzles, and bursts of inspiration.

In this case, we find Hourly Rate billing to be more effective. In this case, rather than planning every detail upfront, we sketch out a broad plan, then get to creating. This gives us the power to incorporate new ideas, embrace change, and launch the best possible project, while still being mindful of budget.

However, some projects already have very clear requirements. In this case, a Project Rate can be effective and easier to understand.

## Budget
We do need to know clients' budgets. This is often uncomfortable for them but their budget helps determines what scope is possible. It saves time. If they don't know their budget, we discuss different options.

For example, we may talk about breaking product rollout into stages and try to improve the product's chances of success at each stage by:

* Focusing on a small subset of features.
* Designing a valuable user experience.
* Developing a meaningful relationship with users.
* Budgeting for marketing tactics to tell users about the product.
* Designing interactions into the product for users to bring other users to the product.

Reducing project complexity and scope is the best way to reduce project budget.

## Payments
We use WaveApp to send invoices. It automatically sends late payment notifications, limiting awkward conversations about the bill. Clients can pay their invoice via credit card, paypal, or check.

**Project Rate Payments**

* Payments of less that $1,000 are due upon reciept.
* Payments for projects between $1,000 and $10,000 are split in half, 50% deposit at to begin and the final 50% at the time on deployment.
* Payments for projects between over $10,000 are split into milestones, each due at the acceptance of a particular phase of the project.

**Hourly Rate Payments**

* Payments for hourly projects require a deposit and are billed every 2 weeks with net-7 terms.

**Retainer Payments**

* Payments for retainers are automatically billed to a credit card on file on the 1st of each month.

## Deposits

We require deposits because we provide a specialzed service.
