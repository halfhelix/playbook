## Communication
## Budgets

It’s important that we know our client’s budget. Buying design or development, just like buying a car, is a financial transaction. In fact, one of the first questions we ask prospective clients is about their budget. This question tends to make people uncomfortable, but their budget helps determine what scope is possible. Most of all, that number tells us how to guide the client toward the best solution from the beginning, and to stay away from solutions that are outside of their price range.

Not everyone knows what their budget is and that’s ok. It just means we’ll discuss a few options. Some below your price range, some above. Often, we talk about breaking a project rollout, and thus payments, into stages by focusing on smaller subsets of features.

## Rates

We price projects based on time. Usually this is calculated hourly or weekly. We use the same rate for designers and developers. The work required for a project dictates the number of people and amount of time, which then determines the cost and how quickly things get done.

## Contracts

Our project contract contains:

- Agreement that the client owns all paid work.
- Agreement that both parties won't use materials which break someone else's copyright.
