#  Tool & Systems Guide

## Organizational Tools
Everyone on the team uses these to stay in sync.

*Slack*
Slack is a chat and communication tool that we use in place of Skype. By default, all communication should happen over Slack in our various channels. We might choose to invite clients as Single-Channel Guests to a private group in our Slack if we think it will make our communication more open and effective. There is a web app, desktop app. and mobile app.

*Trello*
Trello stores our tasks in what they call ‘cards’. If someone has a task they should perform, it should be in Trello.

*Google Apps*
We us for Google Apps for Business, which allows us to log into @no2.co emails. It also powers our Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive.

*Google Calendar*
All meetings, both internal and with clients, are managed using Google Calendar.

*Email*
We use email  for interfacing with clients and for signing up for web services. All intra-team communication should be sent over Slack.

*Google Drive*
All documents should live in Google Drive. This includes everything from our financial records to project brainstorms.


## Design & Development Pipeline
We use custom internal tools and publicly available software to optimize the handoff between design and development. This is often the biggest bottleneck in any workflow, but with these tools we are able to move fast and collaborate effectively internally and with our clients.

*InVision*
InVision is a design prototyping platform we use to host the design files / assets (PSD, AI, Etc) and create prototypes. It also is a platforms to provide collaborate on prototype feedback, allowing us to comment, draw, and discuss the prototype directly in the screen.

*Zeplin*
Zeplin is the tool we use to hand off design specs from designer to developer. Zeplin outlines designs by generating dimensions, colors, fonts, and other details from design files to make development easier.

## Development Tools
Here are the tools for building the web front- and back-end of our projects.

*BitBucket*
BitBucket stores all our version of a project code. Aside from acting as the central hub for our code, it also acts as a backup incase anything were to happen to a project server or developers computer. All public repositories should have an up-to-date README.md file.

*GitHub*


## Design
These help us build mockups and prototypes to share ideas with clients and inform development.

*Sketch*
Sketch is a new piece of design software from Bohemian Coding. We use this as the primary tool for user interface (UI) design. One of the great parts of Sketch is its plugin support. We use plugins for small workflow processes and notably Zeplin for speccing.

*Illustrator*
Adobe Illustrator CC is our primary tool for graphics. While Sketch is great at laying out elements, its vector software is less powerful than Adobe’s. Logo design and illustrations happen in Illustrator and are often imported into the other tools for further processing.

*Photoshop*
We use Adobe Photoshop CC primarily for making photorealistic mockups. For example, we can place a screenshot of an interface created in Sketch into a monitor to help clients visualize the final product. We also use it for photo editing, but UI design should never ever be done in PS! While software like Illustrator is a vector editing tool, Photoshop is a raster editing tool for files like PNG, JPG, and GIF.
