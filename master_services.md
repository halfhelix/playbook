# Master Services Agreement Template

This Master Services Agreement (the “Agreement”) shall govern the provision of services to the undersigned client (the “Client”) by ____________________ (“Agency”). Additional terms, such as the services and deliverables to be provided hereunder, the schedule for the delivery thereof and the amount of fees payable therefor are set forth on the attached Statement Of Work (the “SOW”) which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference and may, from time to time, be amended upon the written consent of both parties. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any SOW and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Agreement shall control.

### Additional Services, Project Changes

Any services outside the scope of the SOW or changes to previously approved work requested by the Client shall be the subject of an additional SOW or Change of Scope to be approved in writing by both parties. Each such additional SOW or Change of Scope is hereby incorpoAgencyrated herein by this reference.

### Expenses

Client will be notified in advance for pre-approval of any additional expenses. At Agency’s discretion, Client shall either pay such fees directly to the third-party vendor or reimburse Agency therefore upon presentation of applicable invoices. Agency shall maintain records of expenses. 

### Time of Payment and Late-Payment Charges 

The Client shall pay Agency for the work performed hereunder as set forth on the applicable SOW. In no event will any payment under this Agreement be contingent on receipt of any monies or other compensation by the Client. Delays resulting from the action or inaction of Client may result in an adjustment in fees by Agency, subject to Client approval. Each invoice hereunder is due and payable within 7 days after its invoice date. All rights of the Client herein are conditioned on Agency’s receipt of full payment. In addition, Agency may suspend performance of services and withhold delivery of materials until payment in full of all amounts due. Agency shall not be liable for any damages, losses or liabilities that may arise out of Agency’s suspension of performance and/or withholding of materials due to Client’s non-payment. Late payments shall accrue interest at the rate of 5% per month. Agency shall be entitled to all of its costs of collection of amounts outstanding hereunder, including without limitation, the fees of its attorneys.

### Approval of Work 

Work will not commence until the signed SOW has been received. Within five business days following receipt of any deliverables, the Client will provide Agency with either (a) written approval and acceptance of such deliverable (which will not be unreasonably withheld), or (b) a written list of reasonable modification guidelines that will bring the deliverables into compliance with the SOW. Each deliverable hereunder will be deemed accepted by the Client if, within five business days of its delivery to the Client, the Client does not receive the foregoing written notice. The Client's written approval of any deliverables, materials, plans or other Work created or produced by the Agency in the course of the provision of the Services, or any cost estimate, will constitute the Agency’s authority to purchase, publish, and make contracts for talent, space, time and other facilities and otherwise to do any other act or thing which the Agency considers it reasonable to do in order to carry out its obligations under this Agreement or any SOW. The Agency will not be obliged to commit to any expenditure on behalf of the Client without first receiving written confirmation of the Client's instructions and the Agency will not be responsible for the consequences of any delay on the part of the Client in providing such written confirmation.

### Confidential Information; Non-Solicitation 

Confidential information is that which relates to the Client’s or Agency’s research, development, trade secrets or business affairs and includes, in the case of Agency’s confidential information, concepts presented to, but not selected by, the Client; it does not include information that is generally known or easily ascertainable by third parties. Agency and the Client shall mutually respect and maintain each other’s confidential information and shall use it only to perform their respective obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, confidential information does not include information which is public knowledge, was in the recipient’s possession before receipt or is independently developed by the recipient. Neither party shall solicit the other’s employees, independent Agencies or consultants or engage them in any work independent the parties’ relationship under this Agreement during the term of the Agreement and for one year thereafter.
 

### Independant Agency 

The Client is hiring the Agency as an independent Agency. The following statements accurately reflect their relationship:

- The Agency will use its own equipment, tools, and material to do the work.
- The Client will not control how the job is performed on a day-to-day basis. Rather, the Agency is responsible for determining when, where, and how it will carry out the work.
- The Client and the Agency do not have a partnership or employer-employee relationship.
- The Agency cannot enter into contracts, make promises, or act on behalf of the Client.
- The Agency is responsible for its own taxes.
- The Client will not withhold social security and Medicare taxes or make payments for disability insurance, unemployment insurance, or workers compensation for the Agency or any of the Agency’s employees or subAgencys.

### Ownership and Licenses.

**Client Owns All Work Product. **
As part of this job, the Agency is creating “work product” for the Client. To avoid confusion, work product is the finished product. The Agency hereby gives the Client this work product once the Client pays for it in full. This means the Agency is giving the Client all of its rights, titles, and interests in and to the work product (including intellectual property rights), and the Client will be the sole owner of it. The Client can use the work product however it wants or it can decide not to use the work product at all. The Client, for example, can modify, destroy, or sell it, as it sees fit.
 
**Agency’s Use Of Work Product. **
Once the Client pays Agency for work product in full and Agency gives the work product to the Client, the Agency does not have any rights to it, except those that the Client explicitly gives the Agency here. The Client gives the Agency permission to use the work product as part of the Agency's portfolio and websites, in galleries, award submission, and in other media, so long as it is to showcase the Agency's work and not for any other purpose. The Agency is not allowed to sell or otherwise use the work product to make money or for any other commercial use. The Client is not allowed to take back this license, even after the Contract ends.

**Agency’s IP That Is Not Work Product.** 
During the course of this project, the Agency might use intellectual property that the Agency owns or has licensed from a third party, but that does not qualify as “work product.” This is called “background IP.” Possible examples of background IP are pre-existing code, type fonts, properly-licensed stock photos, and web application tools. The Agency is not giving the Client this background IP. But, as part of the Contract, the Agency is giving the Client a right to use and license (with the right to sublicense) the background IP to develop, market, sell, and support the Client’s products and services. The Client may use this background IP worldwide and free of charge, but it cannot transfer its rights to the background IP. The Client cannot sell or license the background IP separately from its products or services. The Agency cannot take back this grant, and this grant does not end when the Contract is over. 

**Agency’s Right To Use Client IP.** 
The Agency may need to use the Client’s intellectual property to do its job. For example, if the Client is hiring the Agency to build a website, the Agency may have to use the Client’s logo. The Client agrees to let the Agency use the Client’s intellectual property and other intellectual property that the Client controls to the extent reasonably necessary to do the Agency’s job. Beyond that, the Client is not giving the Agency any intellectual property rights, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Contract. 

### REPRESENTATIONS.
**Overview.**
This section contains important promises between the parties.

**Authority To Sign.** 
Each party promises to the other party that it has the authority to enter into this Contract and to perform all of its obligations under this Contract.

**Agency Has Right To Give Client Work Product.**
The Agency promises that it owns the work product, that the Agency is able to give the work product to the Client, and that no other party will claim that it owns the work product. If the Agency uses employees or subAgencys, the Agency also promises that these employees and subAgencys have signed contracts with the Agency giving the Agency any rights that the employees or subAgencys have related to the Agency’s background IP and work product.

<!--Do we need a timeline? Is this under Approvals?-->
**Client Will Review Work.** 
The Client promises to review the work product, to be reasonably available to the Agency if the Agency has questions regarding this project, and to provide timely feedback and decisions.

**Client-Supplied Material Does Not Infringe. **
If the Client provides the Agency with material to incorporate into the work product, the Client promises that this material does not infringe on someone else’s intellectual property rights.


### TERM AND TERMINATION. 

This Contract is ongoing, until ended by the Client or the Agency. Either party may end this Contract for any reason by sending an email or letter to the other party, informing the recipient that the sender is ending the Contract and that the Contract will end in 7 days. The Contract officially ends once that time has passed. The Agency must immediately stop working as soon as it receives this notice, unless the notice says otherwise. 

#### GENERAL.

**7.1 Assignment.** 
This Contract applies only to the Client and the Agency. The Agency cannot assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Contract to a third-party (other than by will or intestate), without first receiving the Client’s written permission. In contrast, the Client may assign its rights and delegate its obligations under this Contract without the Agency’s permission. This is necessary in case, for example, another Client buys out the Client or if the Client decides to sell the work product that results from this Contract.

<!--DO WE WANT THIS?-->
**7.2 Arbitration.** 
As the exclusive means of initiating adversarial proceedings to resolve any dispute arising under this Contract, a party may demand that the dispute be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules.

**7.3 Modification; Waiver.** 
To change anything in this Contract, the Client and the Agency must agree to that change in writing and sign a document showing their contract. Neither party can waive its rights under this Contract or release the other party from its obligations under this Contract, unless the waiving party acknowledges it is doing so in writing and signs a document that says so.

**7.4 Severability.** 
This section deals with what happens if a portion of the Contract is found to be unenforceable. If that’s the case, the unenforceable portion will be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, unless that change is not permitted by law, in which case the portion will be disregarded. If any portion of the Contract is changed or disregarded because it is unenforceable, the rest of the Contract is still enforceable.

**7.5 Signatures.** 
The Client and the Agency must sign this document using a e-signing system. These electronic signatures count as originals for all purposes.

**7.6 Governing Law. **
The laws of the state of New York govern the rights and obligations of the Client and the Agency under this Contract, without regard to conflict of law principles of that state.

**7.7 Entire Contract. **
This Contract represents the parties’ final and complete understanding of this job and the subject matter discussed in this Contract. This Contract supersedes all other contracts (both written and oral) between the parties.
