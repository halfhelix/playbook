# Hello

We are NO2. We’re a modern design and development agency.

This is our playbook. It’s the who, what, where, when, and why of our agency. It details how we run client projects and daily operations. It's a combination of things we've learned over the years and a study of others' experiences. It is a living document that is consistently being updated as our processes and preferences evolve.


## Our Company

**Consulting**

We make our living working on client projects. Clients hire us to design and develop web and mobile products for them. Those projects start with discovery and go through a normal flow of designing, developing, shipping, monitoring, and iterating.

**Ventures**

In addtion to client projects, build our own products too. Sometimes this is in conjuction with outside partners, and sometimes we fly solo.

## Operations

**Sales**

We're designers and developers. We want to design and develop products. However before we can do that, we need clients to hire us. Our sales process normally looks something like this:

- Someone contacts us.
- We have a phone call or have them come into the office.
- Make sure we’re a good fit for each other.
- Understand the client's vision.
- Agree to the outcomes we're trying to achieve.
- Estimate Budget and Timelines.
- Schedule Project Schedule.
- Sign the contract.
- Pay us for the first iteration.
- We begin work.

**Budgets**

We do need to [know clients' budgets](https://medium.com/@monteiro/why-i-need-to-know-your-budget-a61ec864c898#.w0wwsmaeh). This is often uncomfortable but the budget helps determines what scope is possible. It saves time. If a client doesn’t know their budget, we help them with a few different options.

For example, we may talk about breaking product rollout into stages and try to improve the product's chances of success at each stage by:

* Focusing on a small subset of features.
* Designing a valuable user experience.
* Developing a meaningful relationship with users.
* Budgeting for marketing tactics to tell users about the product.
* Designing interactions into the product for users to bring other users to the product.

Reducing project complexity and scope is the best way to reduce project budget.

**Rate & Billing**

We have a few [different methods of billing](#), depending on the type of project. Our rates are based on per-person, per-hour. Everyone has the same rate.  The work required for each week dictates which skills are needed. The number of people needed determines the cost and how much gets done.

**Contract**

We keep our contract pretty simple. Our standard contact contains:

1. A one-page summary of the expected work.
2. Our rate.
3. Net 7 payment terms.
4. Ongoing invoicing terms
5. Agreement that the client owns the work code for all work that has been paid for.
6. Agreement that both parties won't use materials which break someone else's copyright.
7. Agreement that both parties won't publish things to the web hosting provider which are abusive or unethical.
8. Agreement that the contract is mutually "at-will" and either side can decide to stop work with a short notice.
9. A page for signatures.

**Invoices**

We use [WaveApp](https://www.waveapps.com/) to send invoices. It automatically sends late payment notifications, limiting awkward conversations about the bill. Clients can pay their invoice via credit card, paypal, check or wire transfer.

**Legal**
Our law firm is Fridman Law Group, PLLC. They are able to provide us with legal support for most everything we need, which is most commonly client or venture contracts.
