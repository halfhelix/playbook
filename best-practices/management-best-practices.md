*Management Best Practices*

General
-------
* These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask
  when in doubt.

Email
-----
* Use a casual and friendly voice. We're not corperate and we shouldnt sound like it.
* Keep reasonable hours. Regardless of what time zone you;re in at the moment, try to only send emails to clients within working hours in Eastern Standard timezone. /Pro Tip: Use the "send Later" fucntion./
* Always use spelling and grammer check before sending.
* If you're expecting a reply, use the "Snooze, unless someone replies" function. 3 days is usually good.


Trello
-----
* Keep card titles to 1 sentence.
* Ensure all "To Do" tasks have an assignee and a due date.
* Each assignee is responsible for keeping their cards up to date.
* Use Trello comments to document progress, not for chat.

Slack
-----
* Use open channels whenevre possible.
* Ensure each channel has proper integrations.
